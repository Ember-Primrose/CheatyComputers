Cruor's Cheaty Computers
========================

A mod made for Cruor because he is too lazy to do crafting in a game that has got "craft" in its name. Allows spawning in fully assembled OpenComputers setups.

I wouldn't use it, you shouldn't use it. Please play OC like it's supposed to be played.
